## Background
-   A dramatic expansion in administrative positions since the late twentieth century in U.S. higher education.

-   Full-time faculty have been replaced by contingent faculty and faculty salary outlay has stayed flat.

-   Debates on administration bloat.

-   Tensions between academic and administrative units.

## Study Purpose
-   Examine the possible trade-off effects between academic and administrative units within U.S. four-year public institutions.

-   The potential impacts of rising administration on institutional performance (student outcomes, faculty productivity).

---
## Reseach Questions
-   How have administrative expenditures been related to investment in faculty (i.e., the amount of faculty, faculty compensation)? To what extent do those relationships exist? 

-   How have such relationships been associated with institutional performance (i.e., student outcomes and research productivity)? 

-   How have such relationships varied across different types of institutions? 

---
## Theoretical Framework
-   Three hypotheses of the relationship between administrative intensity and institutional performance
  -   Contingency theory and resource dependence theory: **Positive**
  
  -   Neo-institutional theory: **Neutral** 
  
  -   Public choice theory: **Negative**

---
## Literature Review
-   Concerns related to rising administration
  -   Administrative bloat
    -   increasing administrative spending, institutional costs, and tuition (Campos, 2015; Mastrodicasa, 2016)
  
  -   Administrative lattice 
    –   “the proliferation and entrenchment of administrative staff” (Massy & Warner, 1991, p.184) 
  
  -   Bureaucratization
    -   academic and administrative bureaucratization (Coccia, 2009)
  
-   Impacts on student outcomes
  -   Debates on whether bureaucracy induces poor performance, otherwise poor performance requires more bureaucracy to make improvements (Chubb & Moe, 1988; Smith & Meier, 1994).
  
  -   Recent studies found administrative level has a curvilinear relationship with organizations’ performance (Boon & Wynen, 2017; Darnley et al., 2019; Rogers, 2012; Ting et al., 2014; Tran & Dollery, 2022).

-   Impacts on faculty
  -   Cooperate to maximize institutional performance.
  
  -   Compete for resources.

-   Heterogeneous effects across institutions

---
## Methodology
-   Panel data analysis

-   Fixed effects model and random effects model
  -   Two-way fixed effects models models with cluster-robust standard errors
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("formula.png")
```


-   Two stages
  -   First stage examines the potential trade-off effect of increasing administration
  
  -   Second stage explores the possible impacts of expanded administration on institutional performance

### Some my code to clean IPEDS data
+ Load IPEDS files 
```{r eval=FALSE}
df <- list.files(
  "path to data", 
  pattern = "*.csv",
  full.names = T) |>
  lapply(read_csv)
```

+ Clean variables' name
  -   e.g., drop prefix and suffix, replace blank and common with underscore
```{r, eval=FALSE}
replacements <- c(" - " = "_",
                  " " = "_",
                  "-" = "_",
                  "/" = "_",
                  "," = "")
for (i in 1:16) {
  df[[i]] <- df[[i]] |>
    setNames(gsub(
      pattern = ".*RV.|.*[0-9]\\.|,.*|:.*",
      replacement = "",
      x= names(df[[i]])
      )
      ) |>
    rename_all(~str_replace_all(.x, replacements))
}
```

+ Calculate variables in multiple files
```{r, eval=FALSE}
for (i in 1:16){
  df[[i]] <- df[[i]] |>
    mutate(
      faculty_salary = rowSums(across(all_of(faculty_salary)),
                             na.rm = TRUE)

setFixest_dict(

              )

# Show results
summary(fix1)
```

---
### Robustness check and tests
-   Hausman test

  -   This test is used to choose between the fixed and the random effects models.

  -   The null hypothesis is that the preferred model is random effects vs. the alternative the fixed effects.


```{r eval=FALSE}
phtest(fixed, random)
```

-   Tests of poolability

  -   Poolability: the same coefficients apply across all individuals.
```{r eval=FALSE}
pooltest(f1, data = pData, model = "within")
```

-   Tests for individual and time effects

  -   It implements Lagrange multiplier tests of individual or/and time effects based on the results of pooling model. 

  -   The null hypothesis is that no two-way fixed effects needed. 
```{r eval=FALSE}
plmtest(pool, effect = "twoways", type = "ghm")
```

## Some tips
`r fa(name = "exclamation", fill = "red", height = "1em")` `r fa(name = "exclamation", fill = "red", height = "1em")` `r fa(name = "exclamation", fill = "red", height = "1em")` Keep learning

`r fa(name = "exclamation", fill = "red", height = "1em")` `r fa(name = "exclamation", fill = "red", height = "1em")` Write data analysis journey
`r fa(name = "exclamation", fill = "red", height = "1em")` Always save your code and data

+ Understand variables' definition and changes in annual surveys

+ Clean workspace before starting

+ Organize your code and your files

+ Using Google to search your questions

+ Figure out your questions

+ The most important thing is to achieve your goals. It does no matter how you write your code

+ Come with your friends and support systems
